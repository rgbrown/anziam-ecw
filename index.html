        <h1>ANZIAM ECR Workshop 2014</h1>
        <p> The ANZIAM Early Career Workshop is a great opportunity for
        early career researchers to meet together for networking,
        cameraderie, and a chance to learn from the experience of some
        great invited speakers. The meeting will be valuable for those
        just starting out their research careers as PhD students, through
        to researchers about five years post-PhD.</p>
        
        <p>Acting on feedback from previous workshops we will focus on
        advice sessions rather than research talks. We plan to have five or
        six sessions on a range of topics including: getting grants,
        writing CVs, academic career paths inside and outside Aus/NZ, and
        balancing research with other commitments. The sessions will be in
        a variety of formats including panel discussions, hands-on active
        workshops and presentations.</p>

        <h2> Where / when / how much? </h2>
        <p>The biennial ANZIAM Early Career Workshop will take place at the
