        <h1>ANZIAM ECR Workshop 2014</h1>
        <p> The ANZIAM Early Career Workshop is a great opportunity for
        early career researchers to meet together for networking,
        cameraderie, and a chance to learn from the experience of some
        great invited speakers. The meeting will be valuable for those
        just starting out their research careers as PhD students, through
        to researchers about five years post-PhD.</p>
        
        <p>Acting on feedback from previous workshops we will focus on advice
        sessions rather than research talks. We plan to have five or six
        sessions on a range of topics including: getting grants, writing
        CVs, academic career paths outside Aus/NZ, and balancing research
        with other commitments. The sessions will be in a variety of
        formats including panel discussions, hands-on active workshops and
        presentations.</p>

        <h2> Where / when / how much? </h2>
        <p>The biennial ANZIAM Early Career Workshop will take place at the
        Millenium Hotel in Rotorua on Friday February 7, 2014, immediately
        following the ANZIAM 2014 meeting at the same venue.</p>

        <p>If you've attended ANZIAM 2014, that meeting finishes on
        Thursday Feb 6. You'll be able to have the afternoon and evening
        exploring the sights and smells of Rotorua, before the workshop
        starts the next day.</p>

        <p>Best of all, thanks to generous support from our sponsors
        <em>Who exactly: ANZIAM, AustMS, NZMS?</em>, registration is free,
        and morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, and a workshop dinner will
        be provided to all registered participants. For those who require
        it, free hostel accommodation for the Thursday and/or Friday nights
        is also available at the local YHA. We have only a strictly
        reserved number of spaces, however, so you'll need to register
        quickly to avoid missing out.

        <h2> Registration </h2>
        <p>All you need to do to register for the workshop is to
        <em>FILLING IN THIS HANDY-DANDY FORM</em> and email it to <em>SOME

        <h2> Travel</h2>

        <p><em>Do you reckon we need some guff about travel? Or we could
            just point them to the <a
                href="http://anziam2014.auckland.ac.nz/where-to-stay/">travel
                details on the ANZIAM page</a>, presumably that link will
            be correct at some point</em> </p>
