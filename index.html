        <h1>ANZIAM ECR Workshop 2014</h1>
        <p> The ANZIAM Early Career Workshop is a great opportunity for
        early career researchers to meet together for networking,
        cameraderie, and a chance to learn from the experience of some
        great invited speakers. The meeting will be valuable for those
        just starting out their research careers as PhD students, through
        to researchers about five years post-PhD.</p>
        
        <p>Acting on feedback from previous workshops we will focus on
        advice sessions rather than research talks. We plan to have five or
        six sessions on a range of topics including: getting grants,
        writing CVs, academic career paths inside and outside Aus/NZ, and
        balancing research with other commitments. The sessions will be in
        a variety of formats including panel discussions, hands-on active
        workshops and presentations.</p>

        <h2> Where / when / how much? </h2>
        <p>The biennial ANZIAM Early Career Workshop will take place at the
        Millenium Hotel in Rotorua on Friday February 7, 2014, immediately
        following the ANZIAM 2014 meeting at the same venue.</p>

        <p>If you've attended ANZIAM 2014, that meeting finishes on
        Thursday Feb 6. You'll then be able to have the afternoon and evening
        exploring the sights and smells of Rotorua, the workshop will be
        9am till 5pm Friday February 7, followed by an informal dinner that
        evening.</p>

        <p>Best of all, thanks to generous support from our sponsors ANZIAM
        and AustMS, registration is free, and morning tea, lunch, afternoon
        tea, and a workshop dinner will be provided to all registered
        participants. For those who require it, free hostel accommodation
        for the Thursday and/or Friday nights is also available at the
        local YHA. We have only a strictly limited number of reserved spaces
        so you'll need to register quickly to avoid missing out.

        <h2> Registration </h2>
        <p>All you need to do to register for the workshop is to tick the
        box on your ANZIAM registration form. We will be in touch with you
        mid-December to get your details, specific dietary requirements,
        and that sort of thing.

                    <h3>Dr Pen Holland </h3>
                </a>
                Pen Holland is a Research Scientist at Landcare Research.
                She started life as a mathematician but ended up doing a
                PhD in a Biology department, consisting of 95% staring at
                equations and/or computers, and 5% chasing wild boar around
                the English countryside. Then she moved to New Zealand and
                started chasing possums instead. Her current projects range
                from hard sums describing how possums eat trees and kill
                them, models of disease transmission and detectability for
                possum TB, and how resource pulses affect rodent
                populations, and a computer game to teach players how
                complex and uncertain the process of managing forests can
                be.

                of animal behaviour.

                    <h3>Dr James McCaw</h3>
                </a>
                James McCaw is mathematical epidemiologist and an
                    Australian Research Council Future Fellow at the
                    University of Melbourne. After obtaining a PhD in
                    theoretical physics in 2005, he took an unexpected (and
                    unplanned!) detour into the field of infectious disease
                    modelling. Since that time he has been instrumental in
                    developing a vibrant research group in the Melbourne
                    School of Population and Global Health. James'
                    interests range from the application of mathematics to
                    problems in basic biology through to multi-scale
                    integrated health policy analyses. His research
                    findings have been integrated into the Australian
                    Government's Health Management Plan for Pandemic
                    Influenza through numerous contracts since 2006. He
                    also loves his bike and field hockey, which finds him
                    visiting emergency departments rather more often than
                    he would like.
